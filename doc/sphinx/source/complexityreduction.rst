Techniques to reduce proof complexity
=====================================

After verifying your first trivial examples, you will encounter designs which
are not very tractable using formal verification. Fortunately, there are number
of techniques than can be used to reduce the complexity of the formal proofs.

.. todo::

   Describe the techniques here, and link to the examples in the repository.
   Maybe we can even make a table, as we did in the FVM paper. But we cannot
   make exactly the same table now, because the paper can't have been
   previously published. So maybe we make a subsection for each technique and
   add the table after the paper is published

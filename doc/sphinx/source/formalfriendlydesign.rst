Future work: Guidelines on writing formal-friendly designs
=============================================

What to consider, when writing HDL code, in order to make it more
formal-friendly

.. note::

   This section is a work in progress and will be completed in a future release
   of the FVM

At least we want to make our designs:

* Friendly to complexity reduction techniques
* Parameterizable so specific reduction techniques (such as data independence)
  can be applied

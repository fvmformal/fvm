An introduction to Formal Verification
======================================

What is Formal Verification?
----------------------------

definition here

What is Formal Verification good for?
-------------------------------------

- breadth-first instead of depth first
- doesn't work well with wide multiplicators
- gets more difficult with designs that have big latencies

Why can't I just simulate?
--------------------------

Well yes you can, but simulation doesn't catch everything

Will Formal Verification replace the need for simulation?
---------------------------------------------------------

Most probably no. Even the tool vendors state that formal verification should
be used *as a complement* to simulation.

Currently this is the best approach, complementing simulation efforts with
formal verification.

With FVM, it is less difficult that it sounds
---------------------------------------------

Well, historically Formal Verification has been a topic for experts (further
support this statement), but not anymore, with the FVM.

Keep reading to see how Formal Verification can help you make _better_ designs
without that huge quantity of effort (link to next section, and rewrite).

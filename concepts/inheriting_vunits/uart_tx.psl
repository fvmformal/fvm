-- Compare this file with examples/05-uart_tx/uart_tx.psl : by parameterizing
-- the transmision sequence, we don't have to write all that HDL code that
-- is trying to predict the evolution of the circuit. This is great news,
-- because parameterizing sequences is more powerful, less error prone, and
-- less code to write

vunit uart_tx(uart_tx(Behavioral)) {
  inherit uart_tx_sequences;

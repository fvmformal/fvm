# Coverage metrics
These are the coverage metrics generated by FVM. Covercheck reachability is an analysis of where the design reaches without considering the formal properties. Propcheck reachability is the same, but considering the assumptions, which may cause this reachability to cover fewer areas than the previous one. Also, statements or branches included in .psl are included to Propcheck Reachability, but not to Covercheck Reachability; that is another reason why the values may differ. It helps to determine if the assumptions overconstrain the design. Formal observability. Formal signoff.
